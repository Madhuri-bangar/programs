A class in Java is a blueprint for creating objects

When you create an object using the new keyword, the constructor of the
 class is called to initialize the object
 


=========================================
Inheritance:

Inheritance is one of the core concepts of
 object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java
 It allows a new class 
(called the child or subclass) to inherit
 properties and methods from an existing class (called the parent or superclass).
The subclass can use all non-private members 
(fields and methods) of the superclass and can also add new members 
or override existing ones.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Superclass and Subclass:

In your code, AnimalInheritance is the superclass (or parent class),
 and Dog is the subclass (or child class).
The Dog class inherits the eat method from
 AnimalInheritance, meaning that Dog objects can use the eat method 
 without needing to define it themselves.

 polymorphism
 
 ===================================
 Method Overloading in Java
Definition: Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the
 same name but different parameter lists.
 
 
 While resolving Overloaded Methods, Compiler 
 will always give precedence for the child type argument
  than compared with parent type argument.
